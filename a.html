            <h2>Facts About Space</h2>
            <p>Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions.[1] In classical physics, physical space is
            often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless
            four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.[2] The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to
            an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is
            itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.</p>

            <p>In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is
            conceived as curved, rather than flat, as in the Euclidean space. According to Albert Einstein's theory of general
            relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space.[3] Experimental tests of general relativity
            have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.[citation needed]</p>
